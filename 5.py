a = 65
# The key to solving the logical hats puzzles is as follows:
# Each person knows that the number on his hat is either the sum or the difference of the other two. He also knows his number is positive.
# Therefore with no other knowledge, A can only know the number on his hat if B and C are equal. Therefore A's "no" response rules out the numbers 2k,k,k.
# Similarly B's "no" rules out k,2k,k and 2k,3k,k.
# C's "no" rules out k,k,2k and 2k,k,3k and k,2k,3k and 2k,3k,5k.
# A would say "no" unless the situation were 3k,2k,k or 4k,3k,k or 3k,k,2k or 4k,k,3k or 5k,2k,3k or 8k,3k,5k.
# Therefore since A says yes, it must be one of those situations. The only one where A can have 65 is if B has 26 and C has 39.
